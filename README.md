# AI Application

SheCodes-Africa Project - API Infrastructure to handle clients search for a job that is relevant to their domain or area of interest.

## Available Scripts

Run `node app.js` or `npm run dev` ( that is,`nodemon`) for a dev server. Navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Important Note:
The app will automatically reload if you run `nodemon` or `npm run dev` (I have configured this command to help run nodemon as my development server) when you change any of the source files.

The application won't automatically reload if you run `node app.js`, so, ensure to stop the application using `ctrl + c` then re-run `node app.js`
